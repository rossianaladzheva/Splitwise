# Splitwise project 
Course project for a university course on Java.

# Functionality
A client-server console application with functionality similar to the SplitWise app ( www.splitwise.com ).
It works with multiple clients who can update their payments, which are then split between two friends or a group of friends (depending
on the executed command). Every user can see their payment history and their status (who owes to them and whom they owe to).
The data-base used is in the form of files, due to course purposes.
